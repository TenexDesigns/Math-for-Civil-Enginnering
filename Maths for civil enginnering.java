The order in which you study these mathematical areas can depend on your background and goals, but here's a general suggested order that often works well for many students, especially those aiming to pursue fields like Civil Engineering:

1. **Algebra**: Start with basic algebra. This includes understanding concepts like variables, expressions, equations, and functions. You'll also learn about different types of equations like linear, quadratic, and polynomial equations. This knowledge is fundamental to many areas of mathematics and engineering [Source 9](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/239).

2. **Trigonometry**: After algebra, move on to trigonometry. This subject deals with relationships between angles and sides of triangles, and it's crucial for fields like architecture, physics, and engineering. Understanding trigonometric ratios and identities is key to solving practical problems [Source 9](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/239).

3. **Geometry**: Geometry involves studying shapes and their properties. It's essential for understanding how objects fit together and interact. For instance, in civil engineering, geometric principles are used to design structures like buildings and bridges [Source 9](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/239).

4. **Calculus**: Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and motion. It's particularly useful in physics and engineering, where it's used to model phenomena like force, velocity, and acceleration. Calculus also provides tools for optimization and finding extrema, which are important in engineering design [Source 11](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Calculus).

5. **Linear Algebra**: Finally, study linear algebra. This area of mathematics deals with vectors, vector spaces, linear transformations, and systems of linear equations. It's extensively used in physics, computer science, and engineering, particularly in areas like machine learning and fluid dynamics [Source 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra).

Remember, this is just a suggested order. Depending on your specific needs and interests, you might find it beneficial to study these subjects in a different order. Always ensure to understand the fundamentals thoroughly before moving on to more complex topics.
