Here's the ideal order for studying those mathematics areas for civil engineering:

**1. Pre-requisites:**

* **Basic Algebra:** Start with mastering basic algebra fundamentals like manipulating expressions, solving equations, inequalities, and functions. This strong foundation is crucial for further subjects.

**2. Core Subjects:**

* **Linear Algebra:** After solid algebra skills, move to linear algebra. This covers vectors, matrices, linear transformations, systems of equations, and eigenvalues/eigenvectors. It's heavily used in structural analysis, stress calculations, and finite element analysis.
* **Calculus:** Next comes calculus, understanding rates of change and integration. Focus on single-variable calculus (Calculus 1 & 2) first, covering differentiation and integration concepts. These are vital for analyzing forces, moments, deflections, and fluid mechanics.
* **Trigonometry:** While basic trigonometry might be familiar from geometry, revisit it to solidify your understanding of trigonometric functions, identities, and solving problems. You'll use these extensively in surveying, analyzing forces and angles, and solving geometric problems.

**3. Supplemental (optional):**

* **Geometry:** While geometry concepts are integrated into other subjects, revisiting basics like points, lines, planes, solids, and their relationships can be helpful for visualization and spatial reasoning in civil engineering applications.
* **Differential Equations:** This advanced subject covers solving various types of differential equations. While not always mandatory, it can benefit some advanced topics like vibration analysis, fluid dynamics, and heat transfer.

**Where in civil engineering?**

Here's how these areas are applied in specific civil engineering sub-disciplines:

* **Structural engineering:** All core subjects are heavily used. Linear algebra for analyzing structures, calculus for calculating forces and deflections, and trigonometry for solving angles and forces.
* **Geotechnical engineering:** Calculus and soil mechanics concepts are key. Also, trigonometry for slope stability and geometry for soil layer analysis.
* **Transportation engineering:** Trigonometry for surveying routes and traffic analysis, calculus for modeling traffic flow and fluid mechanics, and basic algebra for calculations.
* **Water resources engineering:** Calculus for fluid flow analysis, hydraulics, and hydrology. Trigonometry for dam analysis and open channel flow.

Remember, this is a general guide. Your specific program or chosen specialization might have slightly different requirements. Consult your course curriculum or instructors for precise recommendations.

Good luck with your math exploration!
